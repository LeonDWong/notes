## Laws

1. Engineering is done with numbers. Analysis without numbers is only an opinion.
> 工程化是由数字完成的。不包含数字的分析仅仅是观点。

2. To design a spacecraft right takes an infinite amount of effort. This is why it's a good idea to design them to operate when some things are wrong.
> 设计一个好的太空船会花费无止尽的努力。这就是为什么在问题出现的时候再去通过设计使他们运行是一个好主意。

3. Design is an iterative process. The necessary number of iterations is one more than the number you have currently done. This is true at any point in time.
> 设计是一个可迭代的过程。必要的迭代数比你已经做完的迭代数更多。这在任何时候都是真实存在的。

4. Your best design efforts will inevitably wind up being useless in the final design. Learn to live with the disappointment.
> 你最好的设计的努力将会不可避免的在最后设计中变得没用。学会拥抱失望。

5. (Miller's Law) Three points determine a curve.
> 3点决定一个曲线

6. (Mar's Law) Everything is linear if plotted log-log with a fat magic marker.
> 如果用马克笔来做记录的话，每件事都是线性的。

7. At the start of any design effort, the person who most wants to be team leader is least likely to be capable of it.
> 在设计的开始之初，最有资格领导一个队伍的人至少是有能力设计的人。

8. In nature, the optimum is almost always in the middle somewhere. Distrust assertions that the optimum is at an extreme point.
> 自然的说，最适合的往往是在中间某处。不要相信那些说最适合是在极端的断言。

9. Not having all the information you need is never a satisfactory excuse for not starting the analysis.
> 没有你所需的所有信息绝不是作为不开始分析的一个令人信服的借口

10. When in doubt, estimate. In an emergency, guess. But be sure to go back and clean up the mess when the real numbers come along.
> 在怀疑的时候，去鉴定。在紧急的时候，去猜测。但要保证在确定之后能够回过头来处理问题。

11. Sometimes, the fastest way to get to the end is to throw everything out and start over.
> 某些时候，通往终点最快的方法是抛开一切，立马开始。

12. There is never a single right solution. There are always multiple wrong ones, though.
> 正确的解决方式决不止一个。虽然错误的方式有一堆。

13. Design is based on requirements. There's no justification for designing something one bit "better" than the requirements dictate.
> 设计基于需求。某个东西设计得比需求要求的“更好”，并不是一个正当的行为。

14. (Edison's Law) "Better" is the enemy of "good".
> “更好”是“好”的敌人

15. (Shea's Law) The ability to improve a design occurs primarily at the interfaces. This is also the prime location for screwing it up.
> 提升设计的能力最初体现在表面。这也是最初可以把他搞砸的地方。

16. The previous people who did a similar analysis did not have a direct pipeline to the wisdom of the ages. There is therefore no reason to believe their analysis over yours. There is especially no reason to present their analysis as yours.
> 前人所做的类似分析并没有直接得到年代所累积的智慧的恩惠。因此没有理由去觉得他们的分析比你的更可信。更没有理由把他们的分析当成你的。

17. The fact that an analysis appears in print has no relationship to the likelihood of its being correct.
> 分析被公众于世这件事与它正确的可能性无关

18. Past experience is excellent for providing a reality check. Too much reality can doom an otherwise worthwhile design, though.
> 过去的经验对于确认一个件事的真实是非常出色的。虽然过多的真实会会毁掉其他有价值的设计。

19. The odds are greatly against you being immensely smarter than everyone else in the field. If your analysis says your terminal velocity is twice the speed of light, you may have invented warp drive, but the chances are a lot better that you've screwed up.
> 众多的可能性会阻止你变得比世上任何人都聪明。如果你的分析说你的最终速度是光速的两倍，你可能发明了曲速引擎，但更可能的是你搞错了。

20. A bad design with a good presentation is doomed eventually. A good design with a bad presentation is doomed immediately.
> 一个坏的设计加上一个好的表现终究会完蛋。一个好的设计加上一个坏的表现会立马完蛋。

21. (Larrabee's Law) Half of everything you hear in a classroom is crap. Education is figuring out which half is which.
> 你在教室里听的东西有一半是胡扯。受教育就是能够分辨出那一半是哪一半。

22. When in doubt, document. (Documentation requirements will reach a maximum shortly after the termination of a program.)
> 遇到疑问时，用文档记录下来。

23. The schedule you develop will seem like a complete work of fiction up until the time your customer fires you for not meeting it.
> 你开发的计划会像一个完整的小说工作直到你的顾客因为看不到它而把你炒了。

24. It's called a "Work Breakdown Structure" because the Work remaining will grow until you have a Breakdown, unless you enforce some Structure on it.
> 它被称为“工作 故障 架构”，因为“工作”会一直堆积直到“故障”发生，除非你对它强制使用一些“架构”。

25. (Bowden's Law) Following a testing failure, it's always possible to refine the analysis to show that you really had negative margins all along.
> 跟随一个测试的失败，精炼展示你有消极留白的分析。

26. (Montemerlo's Law) Don't do nuthin' dumb.
> 不要做非正演讲这种傻事

27. (Varsi's Law) Schedules only move in one direction.
> 计划只会从一个方向涌进来。

28. (Ranger's Law) There ain't no such thing as a free launch.
> 世上没有那么多的免费的午餐。

29. (von Tiesenhausen's Law of Program Management) To get an accurate estimate of final program requirements, multiply the initial time estimates by pi, and slide the decimal point on the cost estimates one place to the right.
> 要得到一个对于最终项目需求的精确评估，需要把一开始的时间评估乘以PI，并且把十位数的小数点往右移一位。

30. (von Tiesenhausen's Law of Engineering Design) If you want to have a maximum effect on the design of a new engineering system, learn to draw. Engineers always wind up designing the vehicle to look like the initial artist's concept.
> 如果你想要设计新的工程系统的最大的效果，学会去画图。工程师们总是顺利设计一辆跟最初画家概念相似的车。

31. (Mo's Law of Evolutionary Development) You can't get to the moon by climbing successively taller trees.
> 你无法通过爬树去月球。

32. (Atkin's Law of Demonstrations) When the hardware is working perfectly, the really important visitors don't show up.
> 硬件完美工作的时候，真正重要的访客一般都不在。

33. (Patton's Law of Program Planning) A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan next week.
> 一个好的计划热火朝天的立马开工比一个下周的完美的计划更好。

34. (Roosevelt's Law of Task Planning) Do what you can, where you are, with what you have.
> 根据你拥有的，在你所在的地方，尽你所能。

35. (de Saint-Exupery's Law of Design) A designer knows that he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
> 一个设计师知道他做到完美的时候，不是没什么可以加上去的了，而是没什么可以被拿掉的了。

36. Any run-of-the-mill engineer can design something which is elegant. A good engineer designs systems to be efficient. A great engineer designs them to be effective.
> 任何平凡的工程师可以设计出优美的东西。一个好的工程师设计系统来达到高效。一个更好的工程师设计系统来达到有效。

37. (Henshaw's Law) One key to success in a mission is establishing clear lines of blame.
> 在一件任务的成功关键是明确各自的责任。

38. Capabilities drive requirements, regardless of what the systems engineering textbooks say.
> 能力驱动需求，不管系统工程说明书上是怎么说的。

39. Any exploration program which "just happens" to include a new launch vehicle is, de facto, a launch vehicle program.
> 任何“刚好”包含一个火箭的探索项目，实际上，就是一个火箭项目。

39. (alternate formulation) The three keys to keeping a new human space program affordable and on schedule:
       1)  No new launch vehicles.
       2)  No new launch vehicles.
       3)  Whatever you do, don't develop any new launch vehicles.
> 保证一个新的人类太空项目预算足够并且按照计划有三个关键
> 1) 没有新的火箭
> 2) 没有新的火箭
> 3) 不管你做什么，不要开发任何新的火箭

40. (McBryan's Law) You can't make it better until you make it work.
> 直到你让它工作起来之前，你都无法让它变得更好。

41. There's never enough time to do it right, but somehow, there's always enough time to do it over.
> 一直以来都没有足够的时间去做好，但某种程度上，一直都有把它做完的时间。

42. Space is a completely unforgiving environment. If you screw up the engineering, somebody dies (and there's no partial credit because most of the analysis was right...)
> 太空是一个完全无情的环境。如果你在工程中搞砸了，某人会死。
