# Summary

TC39 means Technical Committe 39, which is a part of ECMA, an institution which standardized the javascript language under ECMA specification. [github](https://github.com/tc39\)

# Proposal

All new feature of ES is coming from a proposal. The proposal has many periods.

## Stage 0

Any discussion, change, or addition which has not yet been submmited as a formal proposal is considered to be a "strawman". Only members of TC39 can create those proposals, and it happens so frequently.:)))))))))))

## Stage 1

At Stage 1 a proposal is formalized and expected to address cross-cutting concerns, interactions with other proposals, and implementation concerns. Proposals in this stage identify a discrete problem and offer a concrete solution to that problem.

A Stage 1 proposal often includes a high level API description, usage examples and a discussion of internal semantics and algorithms. These proposals are likely to change significantly as they make their way through the process.

## Stage 2

Proposals in Stage 2 should offer an initial draft of the specification.

At this point, implementers should make some implementations in real world. Like polyfill, babal support and an engine implementation etc....

## Stage 3

Proposals in Stage 3 are candidate recommendations. At this advanced stage, the specification editor and designated reviewers must have signed off on the final specification. A Stage 3 proposal is unlikely to change beyond fixes to issues identified in the wild.

Implementors should have expressed interest in the proposal as well â€” a proposal without support from **implementors** is dead in the water. In practice, proposals move to this level with at least one browser implementation, a high-fidelity polyfill or when supported by a build-time transpiler like Babel.

## Stage 4

Finally, proposals get to Stage 4 when there are at least two independent implementations that pass acceptance tests.

Proposals that make their way through to stage four will be included in the next revision of ECMAScript.
